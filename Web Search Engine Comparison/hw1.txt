As we can see from the Avg. Percent Overlap and Avg. Spearman Coefficient values calculated and stored in the CSV file, the Google and Yahoo search engine results for the 100 given querries are quite different from one another. 
An average overlap value of 24.4% means that the pages retrieved by Yahoo seldom overlap with those returned by Google. On top of this, the average Spearman Coefficient of -5.4 tells us that the the few results that do overlap are uncorrelated. 
It is clear that Yahoo and Google use completely different algorithms to rank and retrieve documents based on user searches. If we were to assume that Google Search Engine is the best in the business, it follows that Yahoo search is pretty far from perfect.
